Following are similar steps from the XPages Extension Library.

 # Accept the license and install the plugin and restart Designer
 # Then verify that the plug-ins are properly installed from the menu _Help->About Domino Designer_ using the plug-in details button, check if there are *org.zkoss.xpage.core* and *org.zkoss.xpage.zss*

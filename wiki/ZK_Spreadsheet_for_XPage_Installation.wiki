=UNDER CONSTRUCTION=

The installation is just like any other XPage extension, ex [http://extlib.openntf.org/ XPages Extension Library].
If you have any problem about installation, please refer to [http://www.openntf.org/Projects/pmt.nsf/122B29BEE5A3E3A58625779F001DEA75/%24file/XPages%20Extension%20Library%20Documentation.pdf document] of XPages Extension Library or other online [http://www.slideshare.net/WorkFlowStudios/xpages-extension-toolkit-library-installation-steps slides], they have more screenshots for the installation. Following are similar steps for spreadsheet.

==Installing the library in Domino Designer==
 # The library is provided as an Eclipse update site which should be installed using the Eclipse update manager. To enable the update manager, you should display the Designer _Preferences->Domino Designer_ and check _Enable Eclipse plug-in installation_
 # Now, the new _File->Application->Install..._ menu is enabled. Select it and choose to install a new feature
 # Add the *updateSite.zip* file
 # Accept the license and install the plugin and restart Designer
 # Then verify that the plug-ins are properly installed from the menu _Help->About Domino Designer_ using the plug-in details button, check if there are *org.zkoss.xpage.core* and *org.zkoss.xpage.zss*

==Installing the library in Domino Server==
 The library is also installed as a set of plug -in in the Domino server, but there is no update manager UI currently available in the Domino server. So you have to do it manually.
 # Unpack the content of the *updateSite.zip* file into the directory(ex, *C:\IBM\Lotus\Notes\Data\domino\workspace\applications\eclipse*) located in your Domino data directory (be careful to strictly respect the directory hierarchy), under eclipse folder, there should be to folder *features* and *plugins*.
 # Then restart your server, or the http task. The library should be available. To verify that the library is properly installed and running command *tell http osgi ss org.zkoss.xpage* . You should get a result showing the plug-ins at least with in the *RESOLVED* state.

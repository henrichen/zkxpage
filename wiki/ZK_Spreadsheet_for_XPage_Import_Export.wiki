#summary How to import and export xlsx file to spreadsheet
=*Under Construction*=
= Model Concept = 
In ZK Spreadsheet, it uses a [http://www.zkoss.org/javadoc/latest/zss/org/zkoss/zss/model/Book.html Book] as its data model. You can set the model using the function {{{spreadsheet.setSrc(file_path_of_excel)}}} and giving it the location to an excel file at {{{WebContent}}} or in the {{{ClassPath}}}. Otherwise, you can use {{{ExcelImporter}}} to import a book model from a {{{File}}} or a {{{InputStream}}}.
To save the book model, you can use {{{ExcelExporter}}} to export a book model to be a byte array so that you could store it in a {{{File}}} or to a {{{OutputStream}}}.

= Load Book =
To use an {{{ExcelImporter}}}, you have to create a new instance of the ExcelImporter, for example: new ExcelImporter(), or retrieve an instantiated object using Importers.getImporter("excel").



you could new it directly or by {{{Importers.getImporter("excel")}}}, following is an example loads a book from a local file.
{{{
public Book loadBook(String name) throws IOException {
	File f = new File(folder, name);
	if (!f.exists() || !f.isFile()) {
		return null;
	}
	ExcelImporter imp = new ExcelImporter();
	Book book = imp.imports(f);
	return book;
}
}}}
It is also possible to load a book from database or other where, you only need to prepare a InputStream and use {{{importer.imports(inputStream,bookName)}}} to import it.
= Save Book =
To use an {{{ExcelExporter}}}, you could new it directly or by {{{Exporters.getExporter("excel")}}}, following is an saves a book to a local file.
{{{
public void saveBook(String name, Book book) throws IOException {
	File f = new File(folder, name);
	OutputStream os = null;
	try {
		os = new FileOutputStream(f);
		ExcelExporter exp = new ExcelExporter();
		exp.export(book, os);
	} finally {
		if (os != null) {
			os.close();
		}
	}
}
}}}
